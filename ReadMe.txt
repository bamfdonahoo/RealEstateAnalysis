These analyses are done off of the real estate data sets that I downloaded from https://www.zillow.com/research/data/. The database was built locally in Microsoft SQL Server Manager where further data cleaning and feature engineering was done prior to exporting the tables to *.csv files for further EDA. A permutation of the same dataset was used for RealEstate Oracle.

At the end of my EDA and data cleaning for my dataset pertaining to the rental market, most of the data is corrupt and mixed together making it useless. On a scatterplot, it looks like data-vomit. No discernable slope or y-intercept, as you can clearly see in my "Data Variance Check". So, for that reason, my final analysis, "CombinedData_LinearRegression",  is done on the sales and mortgage market.
